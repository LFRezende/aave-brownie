# Borrowing-Lending Application
The focus and development of the project encompass the following:


1. Swaping ETH for WETH 
2. Depositing WETH into the contract of WETHGateway.
3. Purchase another token with our ETH collateral
4. Withdrawing the ETH deposited.

## Resources utilized

- For the application to work, we used the Weth Token address on the mainnet (for testing on the Mainnet-Fork) as well as on Goerli.


- The IWeth interface, from @PatrickAlphaC AAVE-BROWNIE repo, for accessing the functions of the token contract.

- The Web3 Development Framework "Brownie" has been employed.
